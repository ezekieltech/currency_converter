<h2>Introduction:</h2><br>
Freecurrencyconverterapi is an API that converts one currency to another and returns result in json format.<br>

<ul>
<ol>All Javascript are written in >=ES6</ol>

<li>Service Worker</li>
<li>Cache API</li>

<li>I have not used any service worker library</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Application Functions</h2>
At minimum users are able to:
